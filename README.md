# OpenSourcePeriodTracker

This project will attmpt to fill a gap that I have seen for period tracking apps. With the overturning of Roe v. Wade, some states are using data obtained from period tracking apps to find people to prosecute for having abortions. This app will be open-source, will *not* sync any data to the internet (all data will be stored locally, and will be easy to clear out in case of emergencies), and will therefor be safe to use going forward. Current plans are to get a basic functioning app working on Android, and to then flesh it out with more features down the line.

If you would like to get involved, we would greatly appreciate developers and testers. Information on how to get in touch will be here soon!

Quick notes about future plans:
- basic period tracking (input start/end dates)
- predict when user's next period will start
- give a few days heads up (default 4?) to the user
- Allow user to configure how far in advance they'd like to be notified
- After basic functionality and predicting is working, add more complicated features
